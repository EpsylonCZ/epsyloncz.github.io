			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h2>19.10.2025</h2>
			<p>Hello, my name is Epsylon and I'm from eastern Europe. I go to computer science school. I like programming, 
			especialy in Python. Also in HTML + CSS. In my free time, I create some projects in terminal using Python3
			or create some websites and I like playing D&D. But I have pirated all of the D&D 5e books,
			becouse I refuse to pay those fucking woke jews for overpriced books especialy now, when the new 2024
			edition is full of bullshit lgbtq propaganda which is disguting. So these books will be available there.</p>
			<p>As you can see, I like Frutiger Aero aesthetics. When i was little, my granpa had laptop with
			Windows 7 and i could spend hours just looking at the file browser or marble place. It was beatiful!
			Even though i very dislike Microsoft, (I use Linux) i must say that this futuristic/eco design
			made part of my childhood memories.</p>
