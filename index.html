				<h2>24.10.2025</h2>
				<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. I wanted to make my own website, becouse i think that this is
				the best way to have your own online profile. I mean, social media could be good, but if you want to
				fully express yourself on the internet, just learn a little bit of HTML and CSS and you can express
				yourself without any limitations!</p>
				<p>I go by nickname Epsylon, I am from Czech republic and i study computer science. I started
				creating little HTML sites when i was 10 and it was very fun, so when i grew older, i decided to
				go study the computer school. We learn Python there, so I have a strong bond with Python.
				In future, I will leave links to my Python projects i posted on Github somewhere on this website.</p>
				<p>The last thing I would want to mention is that i like DnD, and creating my own homebrew rules, so
				I would love to write something about that also!</p>
				<p>Well, I think this should be enough. So take a look around here and maybe you will find something
				you like :)</p>
