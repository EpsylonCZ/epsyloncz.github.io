			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h2>21.10.2025</h2>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. I wanted to make my own website, becouse i think that this is
			the best way to have your own online profile. I mean, social media could be good, but if you want to
			fully express yourself on the internet, just learn a little bit of HTML and CSS and you can express
			yourself without any limitations!</p>
			<p>I go by nickname Epsylon, I am from Czech republic and i study computer science. I started
			creating little HTML sites when i was 10 and it was very fun, so when i grew older, i decided to
			go study the computer school. We learn Python there, so I have a strong bond with Python.
			In future, I will leave links to my Python projects i posted on Github somewhere on this website.</p>
			<p>As you can see, i love this retro technology style from the 2000s. I remember it only a little
			from childhood, from my granpa's Windows 7 laptop (i started HTML on that laptop btw!). But it
			just seems so cool to me.</p>
			<p>The last thing I would want to mention is that i like DnD, and creating my own homebrew rules, so
			I would love to write something about that also!</p>
			<p>Well, I think this should be enough. So take a look around here and maybe you will find something
			you like :)</p>
